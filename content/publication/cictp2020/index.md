abstract: The visibility between any two points in the highway can be judged by analysis of the 3D line of sight, which is of great significance for the inspection of the 3D highway line of sight and the determination of the sight triangle of the intersection. The paper focuses on the inspection methods and visibility analysis of highway 3D line of sight based on the principle of the line of sight analysis and the Civil 3D platform. Based on the review and evaluation of the sight distance inspection module of Civil3D platform, a reasonable definition of a three-dimensional line of sight was proposed, and the pasting algorithm of surfaces was designed. Three 3D sight distance calculation algorithms were compared and analyzed, then a fixed step scanning algorithm for sight distance inspection was designed.
