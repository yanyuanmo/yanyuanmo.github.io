abstract: "Geological factors are key elements in highway route selection. Current BIM software and other mainstream route design software lack geological information support for the route design process in their three-dimensional terrain models. In highway route selection design, providing more geological information support for designers has become an urgent problem to solve. This thesis focuses on route selection problems, studying geological three-dimensional model construction methods, and taking karst area route selection as an example to build a geological route selection knowledge base. The thesis establishes a highway three-dimensional geological model, including three modules: three-dimensional geological modeling, geological longitudinal section cutting, and transverse cutting. Based on geological drilling data, drilling-related algorithms including key geometric spatial point search algorithms and three-dimensional drilling entity drawing algorithms are proposed, along with DEM+ATP-based geological modeling algorithms to establish a three-dimensional geological model. Drilling screening algorithms and longitudinal section cutting algorithms are proposed, developing a geological longitudinal section cutting module. Custom cutting algorithms and vertical route cutting algorithms are proposed, developing a geological transverse cutting module. The thesis establishes a highway geological route selection knowledge base, including digital geological object models, knowledge reasoning modules under CAD+GIS environment, and route selection knowledge base management modules. Based on geological remote sensing interpretation results, geological element input modes and element insertion processes are designed to establish digital geological object models. Combining spatial relationship-based reasoning mechanisms and uncertainty rule reasoning mechanisms, a knowledge reasoning module under CAD+GIS environment is established. Based on rule knowledge base and case knowledge base, a route selection knowledge base management module architecture is constructed. The geological three-dimensional model established in the thesis can provide information such as geological rock properties, stratum distribution, and drilling distribution in the route design process. The combination of three-dimensional geological model and digital geological object model forms a three-dimensional geological route selection environment. The knowledge base provides rule guidance and case reference for the route selection process, realizing information support for highway route selection. The research results have theoretical and practical value in improving the knowledge level in the route design process and promoting the scientific nature of highway geological route selection design and decision-making."
